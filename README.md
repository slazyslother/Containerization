# Containerization

This project involves containerizing a multi-tier web application using Docker. Docker containers provide a lightweight and portable way to package applications and their dependencies. Additionally, Docker Compose files will be created to manage multiple containers as a single application stack. Finally, the application will be deployed using a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes for efficient management and scaling.

<br/>

## Features

- __Containerization__: Package each component of the multi-tier web application into Docker containers.
- __Docker Compose__: Use Docker Compose to define and manage the multi-container application stack.
- __Container Orchestration__: Deploy and manage the application using a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes.
- __Scalability__: Implement scaling capabilities to handle changes in workload demand efficiently.

<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __Dockerfile__: Define Dockerfiles for each component of the web application.
- __Docker Compose Configuration__: Define Docker Compose YAML files to orchestrate the multi-container application.
- __Kubernetes Deployment Configuration__: Define Kubernetes deployment YAML files to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.

<br/>

## Implementation

- __Docker Containerization__: Write Dockerfiles for each component of the multi-tier web application to define their respective container environments.
- __Docker Compose Setup__: Define Docker Compose YAML files to describe the multi-container application stack, including services, networks, and volumes.
- __Kubernetes Deployment__: Create Kubernetes deployment YAML files to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.
- __Scaling Configuration__: Configure Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale the application based on resource utilization metrics.

<br/>

## Testing

- __Containerization Testing__: Ensure each component of the web application runs correctly within its Docker container.
- __Integration Testing__: Test the interaction between different components of the multi-tier application stack.
- __Scalability Testing__: Test the ability of the application to scale up and down based on workload demand.

<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Local Development Environment__: Use Docker Compose to spin up the multi-container application stack locally for development and testing.
- __Container Orchestration Deployment__: Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster and verify its functionality.
- __Scaling Test__: Increase the workload on the application and observe Kubernetes automatically scale the application based on resource usage.
